I’m currently in high school, studying a scientific major (which includes subjects like algebra, chemistry, and computer science), and in a couple of years, I’ll have to decide what to study at university for my future, but the mere thought of that genuinely horrifies me due to an existential doubt: will AI ever replace my job? Imagine paying all the expenses for university, do nothing but study and while you’re still studying, AI is already replacing your future job, taking over the industry you were supposed to work in.  AI is already able to code, analyze economic data, work as your accountant, and even act as a scientific researcher. It explores self-improving mechanisms and one day will be better than anyone living on planet Earth. What am I supposed to do then? I wanted to pursue a coding career, specializing in software engineering, optimization, performance, and similar fields.   Plan B would have been to pursue an economy-driven career, studying marketing, etc. I am pretty sure AI is already great at those, let alone what it will be capable of in a few years. What should I do? Am I overestimating the situation?	reddit	214	7

21	Who should be charged with responsibility for an artificial intelligence performing market manipulation have been discussed. In this study, I constructed an artificial intelligence using a genetic algorithm that learns in an artificial market simulation, and investigated whether the artificial intelligence discovers market manipulation through learning with an artificial market simulation despite a builder of artificial intelligence has no intention of market manipulation. As a result, the artificial intelligence discovered market manipulation as an optimal investment strategy. This result suggests necessity of regulation, such as obligating builders of artificial intelligence to prevent artificial intelligence from performing market manipulation.	arxiv	98	4

29	"This article reviews the ""Once learning"" mechanism that was proposed 23 years ago and the subsequent successes of ""One-shot learning"" in image classification and ""You Only Look Once - YOLO"" in objective detection. Analyzing the current development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the proposal is that AI should be clearly divided into the following categories: Artificial Human Intelligence (AHI), Artificial Machine Intelligence (AMI), and Artificial Biological Intelligence (ABI), which will also be the main directions of theory and application development for AI. As a watershed for the branches of AI, some classification standards and methods are discussed: 1) Human-oriented, machine-oriented, and biological-oriented AI R&D; 2) Information input processed by Dimensionality-up or Dimensionality-reduction; 3) The use of one/few or large samples for knowledge learning."	arxiv	122	3
30	Complex systems fail. I argue that failures can be a blueprint characterizing living organisms and biological intelligence, a control mechanism to increase complexity in evolutionary simulations, and an alternative to classical fitness optimization. Imitating biological successes in Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence can be misleading; imitating failures offers a path towards understanding and emulating life it in artificial systems.	arxiv	59	3
31	Artificial Intelligence applications gradually move outside the safe walls of research labs and invade our daily lives. This is also true for Machine Learning methods on Knowledge Graphs, which has led to a steady increase in their application since the beginning of the 21st century. However, in many applications, users require an explanation of the Artificial Intelligences decision. This led to increased demand for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence. Knowledge Graphs epitomize fertile soil for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence, due to their ability to display connected data, i.e. knowledge, in a human- as well as machine-readable way. This survey gives a short history to Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. Furthermore, we contribute by arguing that the concept Explainable Artificial Intelligence is overloaded and overlapping with Interpretable Machine Learning. By introducing the parent concept Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence, we provide a clear-cut distinction of both concepts while accounting for their similarities. Thus, we provide in this survey a case for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs consisting of Interpretable Machine Learning on Knowledge Graphs and Explainable Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. This leads to the introduction of a novel taxonomy for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. In addition, a comprehensive overview of the research on Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs is presented and put into the context of the taxonomy. Finally, research gaps in the field of Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs are identified for future research.	arxiv	236	14
32	Terms Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Human-Level Artificial Intelligence (HLAI) have been used interchangeably to refer to the Holy Grail of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, creation of a machine capable of achieving goals in a wide range of environments. However, widespread implicit assumption of equivalence between capabilities of AGI and HLAI appears to be unjustified, as humans are not general intelligences. In this paper, we will prove this distinction.	arxiv	69	3
33	Thanks to rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in recent years, the current artificial intelligence technology is contributing to many part of society. Education, environment, medical care, military, tourism, economy, politics, etc. are having a very large impact on society as a whole. For example, in the field of education, there is an artificial intelligence tutoring system that automatically assigns tutors based on student's level. In the field of economics, there are quantitative investment methods that automatically analyze large amounts of data to find investment laws to create investment models or predict changes in financial markets. As such, artificial intelligence technology is being used in various fields. So, it is very important to know exactly what factors have an important influence on each field of artificial intelligence technology and how the relationship between each field is connected. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze artificial intelligence technology in each field. In this paper, we analyze patent documents related to artificial intelligence technology. We propose a method for keyword analysis within factors using artificial intelligence patent data sets for artificial intelligence technology analysis. This is a model that relies on feature engineering based on deep learning model named KeyBERT, and using vector space model. A case study of collecting and analyzing artificial intelligence patent data was conducted to show how the proposed model can be applied to real world problems.	arxiv	228	12
34	The rapid development of artificial intelligence has brought the artificial intelligence threat theory as well as the problem about how to evaluate the intelligence level of intelligent products. Both need to find a quantitative method to evaluate the intelligence level of intelligence systems, including human intelligence. Based on the standard intelligence system and the extended Von Neumann architecture, this paper proposes General IQ, Service IQ and Value IQ evaluation methods for intelligence systems, depending on different evaluation purposes. Among them, the General IQ of intelligence systems is to answer the question of whether the artificial intelligence can surpass the human intelligence, which is reflected in putting the intelligence systems on an equal status and conducting the unified evaluation. The Service IQ and Value IQ of intelligence systems are used to answer the question of how the intelligent products can better serve the human, reflecting the intelligence and required cost of each intelligence system as a product in the process of serving human.	arxiv	162	5
35	Trust between humans and artificial intelligence(AI) is an issue which has implications in many fields of human computer interaction. The current issue with artificial intelligence is a lack of transparency into its decision making, and literature shows that increasing transparency increases trust. Explainable artificial intelligence has the ability to increase transparency of AI, which could potentially increase trust for humans. This paper attempts to use the task of predicting yelp review star ratings with assistance from an explainable and non explainable artificial intelligence to see if trust is increased with increased transparency. Results show that for these tasks, explainable artificial intelligence provided significant increase in trust as a measure of influence.	arxiv	111	5
36	We attempt to define what is necessary to construct an Artificial Scientist, explore and evaluate several approaches to artificial general intelligence (AGI) which may facilitate this, conclude that a unified or hybrid approach is necessary and explore two theories that satisfy this requirement to some degree.	arxiv	46	1
